# First-Person Level Prototype (Unity)

## Project Description

This project is a small 3D first-person level prototype created in Unity using simple geometric primitives such as cubes, cones, and other basic shapes.

The project focuses on basic level design, player interaction, and simple gameplay mechanics within a 3D environment.

## Features

The level includes the following gameplay elements:

- First-person player controller  
- Spikes acting as traps  
- Collectible coins  
- Doors controlled by buttons  
- Teleporters  
- Moving platforms  

All mechanics are implemented in a simple form for learning and demonstration purposes.
